I'm **Valentin Bersier**, a software engineer out of Switzerland.

Having studied Materials Science and Engineering at EPFL in Lausanne, I was however always passionate about software 
and have been writing code since about 2005.

Also known as 'beeb' and 'Krizzli' in some circles, I have a plethora of passions ranging from electronic music production &
DJing 🎧 to mountaineering 🏔️, electronics, drone racing, 3d-printing 🔨, and more.

My main passion however, is computer programming. With this [blog](/blog), I hope to share some thoughts and insights 
about my developer endeavours, focusing on the 🦀 [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) programming language, blockchain 
development (my current day job), web development with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) and more.
