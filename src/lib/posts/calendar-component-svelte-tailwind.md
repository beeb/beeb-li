## Introduction

Recently, I needed to create a localized calendar view for a website and decided to craft it from scratch, instead of
relying on a pre-made component. I often prefer this approach when developing with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) because
it reduces the number of dependencies of the project and allows to really understand how things work under the hood.
This in turns makes maintenance or changes easier and it's also fun!

In recent years/months, browser support for internationalization in JavaScript has reached an "okay" level, and it was
surprisingly easy to achieve a satisfactory result that works for most locales without relying on an external library
(except for a small polyfill).

## HTML Markup

We want to display our monthly calendar view as a table, like you're probably used to seeing. Each column will represent
a day, and each row will represent a week. Since we want our view to update according to the locale's preferences,
the first column will sometimes represent Monday, sometimes Sunday or Saturday, sometimes even [Friday](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Week).

<Image

  alt="A world map showing each country with a color representing which day of the week is considered the first in
  calendars"
  caption="World map showing the first day of the week used in different countries."
  source="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:First_Day_of_Week_World_Map.svg"
/>

Since html tables are painful to work with and style, I opted for a collection of `<div>`'s arranged with CSS into a
grid thanks to the `display: grid` property.

<ChatNote>
<strong>Note</strong>: I'm using <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" rel="nofollow">TailwindCSS</a> in the markup below,
but the same result can be (painfully) achieved with regular CSS too! You can look up the relevant classes in their docs
to find the corresponding CSS code. The button class comes from
<a href="https://daisyui.com/" rel="nofollow">DaisyUI</a>.
</ChatNote>

The base of our layout will be the following:

```html
<div class="flex flex-col">
  <div class="w-full flex flex-nowrap items-center text-center">
    <div>
      <button class="btn" aria-label="See previous month">
        &lt; <!-- left chevron -->
      </button>
    </div>
    <h2 class="grow whitespace-nowrap">
      Month 20xx <!-- this will be formatted according to the locale date formatting and translated -->
    </h2>
    <div>
      <button class="btn" aria-label="See next month">
        &gt; <!-- right chevron -->
      </button>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="w-full grid grid-cols-7 justify-items-center">
    <div>Monday</div> <!-- this might sometimes be another day and will be translated -->
    <div>Tuesday</div>
    <!-- ... -->
  </div>
  <div class="w-full grid grid-cols-7 justify-items-center">
    <!-- the number in the class name below will change for each month -->
    <div class="first:col-start-1">
      1
    </div>
    <div class="first:col-start-1">
      2
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

The first thing to note is that we use the `.grid .grid-cols-7` classes for the heading row (with the day names) and
the main table-like div. This creates a grid with 7 columns as you might expect (gotta love Tailwind for this).

The `.justify-items-center` ensures that each child `<div>` is horizontally centered inside of its grid cell.

Finally and most importantly, not each month will have its first day on a Monday (or whichever the first column day is
according to i18n). As such, we have to skip a few cells to move the first day `<div>` into the right column. This is
achieved with the `.col-start-#` classes and should only be applied to the first day element. It will automatically
offset the next elements along with it, and all elements will wrap according to our preference of 7 columns.

Since we want to generate those elements dynamically using JavaScript, it's much easier if we apply the same classes to
each day element, so we prepend our class with
[`first:`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#first), which will only apply to the element if
it's the first child of its parent.

## The Result

Here's the final result after implementing all the things discussed in this article. The [full component source code](https://github.com/beeb/beeb-li/blob/main/src/lib/posts/calendar-component-svelte-tailwind/Calendar.svelte) is available on GitHub.

<div class="not-prose w-full">
  <LocalePicker {handler} />
  <Calendar {locale} />
</div>

## Conclusion

*[CSS]: Cascading Style Sheets
*[i18n]: internationalization
