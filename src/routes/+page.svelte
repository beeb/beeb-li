  <h1>Hi there!</h1>
  <p>
    I'm <strong>Valentin Bersier</strong>, a software developer out of
    Switzerland.
  </p>
  <p>
    Having studied Materials Science and Engineering at EPFL in Lausanne, I was
    however always passionate about software and have been writing code since
    about 2004.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am known as 'Krizzli' in some circles and have a plethora of passions
    ranging from electronic music production & DJing, to electronics, drone
    racing, 3d-printing, cryptocurrencies and more.
  </p>
  <p>
    My main passion however, is computer programming. With this
    <a href="/blog">blog</a>, I hope to share some thoughts and insights about
    my developer endeavours, focusing on the
    <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" rel="external">Rust</a> programming language,
    blockchain development (my current day job), web development and more.
